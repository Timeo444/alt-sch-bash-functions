My name is Ekerin Oluwatimileyin Moses, and I am 23-year-old Nigerian student studying Chemical Engineering at Obafemi Awolowo University. However, I am also a student of AltSchool Africa offering a one year diploma certification in Cloud Engineering.

My goals for joining AltSchool Africa are multifaceted. I aim to gain specialized knowledge by deepening my understanding of cloud engineering and related technologies through their structured and updated curriculum.
